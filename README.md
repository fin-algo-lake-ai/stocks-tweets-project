Train and test CatBoost and Tranformer (Roberta) models.

### [nb310_model-blend.ipynb](notebooks/nb310_model-blend.ipynb)   
Train and test Naive Bayes model.
Creating ensemble of 3 models (Naive Bayes, CatBoost, Transformer).


### [nb320_added_business_metrics.ipynb](notebooks/nb320_added_business_metrics.ipynb)
